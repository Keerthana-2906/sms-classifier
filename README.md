# SMS Classifier Project

## Overview
This project aims to classify SMS messages as either "spam" or "ham" (non-spam) using data science techniques. The dataset used for training and testing the classifier consists of labeled SMS messages indicating whether they are spam or ham.

## Requirements
To run this project, you'll need:
- Python (version 3.x)
- Jupyter Notebook or google collab(for running the code interactively)
- Libraries such as pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, and matplotlib

## Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required libraries using pip:
   
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
   
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook file (sms_classifier.ipynb) using Jupyter Notebook.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains SMS messages labeled as "spam" or "ham". It is available in the data directory of this repository.

## Project Structure
- sms_classifier.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.
- data/: Directory containing the dataset files.
- README.md: This README file providing an overview of the project.

## Usage
1. Open the sms_classifier.ipynb notebook.
2. Follow the instructions provided in the notebook to execute the code cells sequentially.
3. Train the model, evaluate its performance, and make predictions on new SMS messages.

## Results
The notebook contains detailed analysis and evaluation of the classifier's performance. Results, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, are presented along with visualizations for better understanding.
